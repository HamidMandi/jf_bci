This directory contains all the files needed to fix the matlab repmat and multi-dimensional multiply bugs. 

To install:
1) Put all these files in a directory where matlab can see them.
2) There is no step 2. ;-)

(Actually the codes are written such that matlab will automatically make the required mex files when you first use them -- provided you matlab is set-up correctly this should be transparent to you).

To get help:
help repop
or 
help tprod
from the matlab prompt

For a demo of the codes and also to test their correctness use:
repop_testcases
or 
tprod_testcases
